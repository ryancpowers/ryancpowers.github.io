    "text": "Many fans across the NFL have had the chance to see their team in the playoffs over the past decade, but not Jets fans. Since Steelers rookie Antonio Brown sealed the deal in the 2011 AFC Championship game, Jets fans have not seen a playoff berth. Yes, you read 2011 correctly.\nBack then, Rex Ryan was the defensive mastermind behind the Jets defense and was just short of leading them to the Super Bowl back-to-back years. Now, in 2023, a new defensive expert, Robert Saleh, is looking to bring back the hard-hitting culture to the Big Apple.\nBefore the Saleh era, Jets fans have watched defensive mediocrity for over a decade. Outside of 2015, the team has consistently been ranked as a bottom-tier defense. In 2015, the Jets shot up to 9th place in defensive rankings and came close to breaking their playoff drought. Ironically, the Steelers ended that dream in the final week of the season with a win over the Browns, eliminating the Jets from playoff contention. The Jets only got worse following that season until the arrival of Robert Saleh.\nIn his first season, Saleh’s defense ranked dead last, the team’s lowest ranking since 2010. However, Saleh’s defense put the league on notice this year ending the season ranked 4th overall.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ndefense10 <- read_csv(\"defense10.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2010)\n\ndefense11 <- read_csv(\"defense11.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2011)\n\ndefense12 <- read_csv(\"defense12.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2012)\n\ndefense13 <- read_csv(\"defense13.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2013)\n\ndefense14 <- read_csv(\"defense14.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2014)\n\ndefense15 <- read_csv(\"defense15.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2015)\n\ndefense16 <- read_csv(\"defense16.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2016)\n\ndefense17 <- read_csv(\"defense17.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2017)\n\ndefense18 <- read_csv(\"defense18.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2018)\n\ndefense19 <- read_csv(\"defense19.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2019)\n\ndefense20 <- read_csv(\"defense20.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020)\n\ndefense21 <- read_csv(\"defense21.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021)\n\ndefense22 <- read_csv(\"defense22.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2022)\n\ndefenserankings <- bind_rows(defense10, defense11, defense12, defense13, defense14, defense15, defense16, defense17, defense18, defense19, defense20, defense21, defense22)\n\nfilterdefense <- defenserankings %>% select(Rk, Tm, Season)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=defenserankings, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm)) + \n  geom_point(data=defenserankings, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm), size = 2) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#125740\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Defensive Ranking\", \n    title=\"Jets Went From Worst To Top 5\", \n    subtitle=\"After a decade of being mediocre, Robert Saleh has resurrected the Jets defense and put the league on notice.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Ryan Powers\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nA defense cannot go from worst to top 5 overnight, there has to be a factor that contributed to the Jets defensive success this season. In the 2022 NFL Draft, the New York Jets selected cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner.\nDuring his rookie season, Gardner displayed his elite play-style earning the Defensive Rookie of The Year award, a Pro-Bowl spot, and became the first rookie at his position to earn All-Pro status since Ronnie Lott in 1981. Although Gardner did not display a masterclass in the interceptions department, he led the league in pass deflections.\n\n\nCode\nplayers <- read_csv(\"players.csv\")\n\nfullplayer <- players %>% \n  filter(GS > 13) %>%\n  select(Player, PD, Int) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nfullplayer <- fullplayer %>% mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) %>% mutate(Player=gsub(\"+\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nsauce <- fullplayer %>% \n  select(Player, PD, Int) %>%  \n  filter(Player == \"Sauce Gardner\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=fullplayer, aes(x=Int, y=PD), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=sauce, aes(x=Int, y=PD), color=\"#125740\") +\n  geom_text(data=sauce, aes(x= Int, y=PD-1.2, label=Player)) + \n  geom_encircle(data=sauce, aes(x= Int, y=PD), s_shape=.1, expand=.03, colour=\"#125740\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,25)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Interceptions\", \n    y=\"Pass Deflections\", \n    title=\"Sauce Gardner Is The Deflection King\", \n    subtitle=\"He led the league in passes deflected but came up with 2 interceptions ... maybe this is why he chose CB?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Ryan Powers\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nGardner dominated this season batting the ball out of receiver’s hands compared to the rest of the league’s defenders. He was in a league of his own as a rookie! Why did he only come up with 2 interceptions? Maybe he has butter fingers or, realistically, he was in a position where deflecting the ball was the better option.\nWe need to look deeper and see where Gardner really thrived. Gardner received high praise around the league for his lockdown coverage and ability to keep his opponents close. With that being said, the opposing quarterback would not dare to throw his way and if they did, they would pay the price, right? Well, about half of that statement is correct.\n\n\nCode\nplayers2 <- read_csv(\"players2.csv\")\n\nplayers2 <- players2 %>% mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) %>% mutate(Player=gsub(\"+\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nfilterscat <- players2 %>% \n  filter(GS > 13) %>%\n  filter(Pos == \"DB\" | Pos == \"CB\" | Pos == \"S\") %>% \n  na.omit()\n\nsauce2 <- filterscat %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Sauce Gardner\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=filterscat, aes(x=Rat, y=Tgt), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=sauce2, aes(x=Rat, y=Tgt), color=\"#125740\") +\n  geom_text(data=sauce2, aes(x= Rat, y=Tgt+3, label=Player)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 89.67632) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 62.76316) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=65, y=100, label=\"More Targets, Lower QB Rating\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=115, y=40, label=\"Less Targets, Higher QB Rating\"), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"QB Passer Rating\", \n    y=\"Targets\", \n    title=\"Were Receivers Lost In The Sauce?\", \n    subtitle=\"He was targeted more than the average player this season but his opponents rarely came down with the ball.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Ryan Powers\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to the rest of the NFL’s secondary, Sauce Gardner was targeted substantially high but what sets him apart is what happened after the ball left the quarterback’s hands. He was all over his opponents and placed in an elite category of being targeted high with a low QB rating allowed.\nNow entering his second season in the NFL, Gardner has solidified himself as one of the franchise cornerstones of an increasingly successful defense. It has been a long 12 years for the New York Jets organization and their fans, but Gardner looks to continue his lockdown play-style and bring the “same old Jets” back to the glory days."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After years of disappointment and no bowl games to look forward to, the Cornhuskers are marking a new chapter, hiring former Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule. Rhule is returning to college football where he made a name for himself to begin with. He began his head coaching career with Temple University (2013-2016) and Baylor University (2017-2019). The former NFL coach is replacing Scott Frost, whose 5-year tenure with Huskers (2018-2022) did not end as many fans would have hoped.\nMoving on from Frost was recognized as a huge win by Husker fans but there is an interesting story to tell between the team’s new hire and their former coach. They have both coached 7 years in college football, Frost has coached a few less games due to his departure this past season, and their career win percentages are within reach of one another. Rhule arrives at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a win percentage of 0.552% and Frost left with a 0.479% only separating the two by 0.043%.\nDo the two have similar season histories when it comes to winning? Are the Cornhuskers digging a deeper hole than the one already existing? Well, not exactly. During Frost’s first season at the University of Central Florida, he achieved an average season of 6-7. After, he achieved the notorious 13-0 undefeated season resulting in a Peach Bowl win. While Husker football fans went crazy after the hiring of Frost in 2018, little did they know he would never achieve another season over 0.500, let alone win more than 5 games. Coach Rhule displays a different pattern than Frost off the bat with the experience he has gained since 2013. To dive deeper, it seems it takes 2 years before his respective programs began winning.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nrhulerecord <- read_csv(\"rhulerecord.csv\")\n\nfrostrecord <- read_csv(\"frostrecord.csv\")\n\nfrost2016avg <- read_csv(\"frost2016avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2016)\n\nfrost2017avg <- read_csv(\"frost2017avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2017)\n\nfrost2018avg <- read_csv(\"frost2018avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2018)\n\nfrost2019avg <- read_csv(\"frost2019avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2019)\n\nfrost2020avg <- read_csv(\"frost2020avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2020)\n\nfrost2021avg <- read_csv(\"frost2021avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2021)\n\nrhule2013avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2013avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2013)\n\nrhule2014avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2014avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2014)\n\nrhule2015avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2015avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2015)\n\nrhule2016avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2016avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2016)\n\nrhule2017avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2017avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2017)\n\nrhule2018avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2018avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2018)\n\nrhule2019avg <- read_csv(\"rhule2019avg.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2019)\n\nrhuleavg <- bind_rows(rhule2013avg, rhule2014avg, rhule2015avg, rhule2016avg, rhule2017avg, rhule2018avg, rhule2019avg)\n\nfrostavg <- bind_rows(frost2016avg, frost2017avg, frost2018avg, frost2019avg, frost2020avg, frost2021avg)\n\ntemple2013def <- read_csv(\"temple2013def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2013, school=\"Temple\")\n\ntemple2014def <- read_csv(\"temple2014def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2014, school=\"Temple\")\n\ntemple2015def <- read_csv(\"temple2015def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2015, school=\"Temple\")\n\ntemple2016def <- read_csv(\"temple2016def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2016, school=\"Temple\")\n\nbaylor2017def <- read_csv(\"baylor2017def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2017, school=\"Baylor\")\n\nbaylor2018def <- read_csv(\"baylor2018def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2018, school=\"Baylor\")\n\nbaylor2019def <- read_csv(\"baylor2019def.csv\") %>% mutate(season=2019, school=\"Baylor\")\n\nrhuledefense <- bind_rows(temple2013def, temple2014def, temple2015def, temple2016def, baylor2017def, baylor2018def, baylor2019def) %>% mutate(teamseason = paste(school, season))\n\nnewrhulerecord <- rhulerecord %>%\n  select(Year, W, L) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to=\"Outcome\", values_to =\"Count\")\n\nnewfrostrecord <- frostrecord %>%\n  select(Year, W, L) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to=\"Outcome\", values_to =\"Count\")\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=newrhulerecord, aes(x=reorder(Year, Outcome), weight=Count, fill=Outcome)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#9D2235\", \"#154734\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"Will Rhule's History Carry Onto The Cornhuskers?\", subtitle = \"Both coaches have taken a few loses during their careers but Rhule's path to victory is different.\",  x=\"\", y=\"Games\", caption = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=newfrostrecord, aes(x=reorder(Year, Outcome), weight=Count, fill=Outcome)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#E41C38\", \"#BA9B37\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"\", subtitle= \"\", x=\"\", y=\"Games\",  caption=\"Sports Reference College Football | By Ryan Powers\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Rhule doing to help his team succeed after those 2 seasons? Those 2 programs did not go from worst to bowl-eligible overnight. The saying goes “defense wins championships” and it carries into this situation. In his first year with Temple and Baylor, Rhule’s defenses gave up an average of over 450-yards per game while the offense was gaining relatively 400-yards per game. Following that first season, his team noticeably improved defensively and went back-and-forth offensively. During the team’s best seasons, 2016 and 2019, they recorded the lowest average for defensive yards per game allowed.\nOn the other hand, Frost displayed an incredible offensive refinement from 2016-2017, arrived in Nebraska and did not progress or regress in 5 seasons. Even surrounding Rhule’s Baylor teams, the question still lies how Frost did not win more than 5 games at least once.\n\n\nCode\nfilterrhuleavg <- rhuleavg %>%\n  filter(Split != \"Difference\") %>%\n  select(season, Split, Yds) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Split, values_from = Yds) %>%\n  mutate(\n    SchoolColor = case_when(\n      season <= 2016 ~ \"Temple\",\n      season >= 2017 ~ \"Baylor\"\n    ),\n    TeamSeason = paste(SchoolColor, season)\n  )\n\nfilterfrostavg <- frostavg %>%\n  filter(Split != \"Difference\") %>%\n  select(season, Split, Yds) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Split, values_from = Yds) %>%\n  mutate(\n    SchoolColor = case_when(\n      season <= 2017 ~ \"UCF\",\n      season >= 2018 ~ \"Nebraska\"\n    ),\n    TeamSeason = paste(SchoolColor, season))\n\ncoaches <- bind_rows(filterfrostavg, filterrhuleavg)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=filterrhuleavg, aes(x=Offense, y=Defense, color=SchoolColor)) +\n  geom_point(data=filterfrostavg, aes(x=Offense, y=Defense, color=SchoolColor)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=365, y=461, label=\"First seasons ->\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#154734\", \"#E41C38\", \"#8A8D8F\", \"#FFC904\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=coaches,\n    aes(x=Offense, y=Defense, label=TeamSeason)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Avg.

Tackling better and attacking the quarterback was all he needed to develop top tier Division I football programs. The more he attacked the quarterback, the more opportunities for the secondary to pick off the football. On the next chart, the bigger the bubble means more interceptions during that season. Being one of the worst defenses in football this past season, the Blackshirts have a lot to improve on to make opportunities for their offense.\n\n\nCode\nnewrhuledefense <- rhuledefense %>%\n  select(season, school, teamseason, Tot, Sk, Int)\n\nrhuleseasontotals <- newrhuledefense %>%\n  group_by(season, school, teamseason) %>%\n  summarise(\n    totaltackles = sum(Tot),\n    totalsacks = sum(Sk),\n    totalinterceptions = sum(Int, na.rm=TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=rhuleseasontotals,\n    aes(x=totaltackles, y=totalsacks, size=totalinterceptions, color=school)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"#154734\", \"#9D2235\")) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=rhuleseasontotals,\n    aes(x=totaltackles, y=totalsacks, label=teamseason),\n    nudge_y = 2\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Tackles\",\n    y=\"Total Sacks\",\n    title=\"A Disciplined Defense Creates Bowl Opportunities\",\n    subtitle=\"Creating positive plays defensively allowed Matt Rhule to evolve Temple and Baylor's football programs.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference College Football | By Ryan Powers\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska football fans have a lot to look forward to this season. Coach Rhule brings a winning culture and experienced staff to a suffering Cornhusker fanbase. Unfortunately, Husker fans may have to wait 2 years before witnessing greatness in Memorial Stadium."
